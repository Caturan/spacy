What not included in a pipeline package that we can load into spaCy? 
a) A config file describing how to create the pipeline. 
b) Binary weights to make statistical predictions. 
c) The labelled data that the pipeline was trained on. 
d) Strings of the pipeline's vocabulary and their hashes. 

The answer is (c) the labelled data that the pipeline was trained on. 
Trained pipelines allow us to generalize based on a set of training examples. 
Once they are trained, they use binary weights to make predictions. That's why it's not necessary to ship them with their training data.
