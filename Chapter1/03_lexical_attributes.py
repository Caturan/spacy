    In this example, we will use spaCy Doc and Token objects, and lexical attributes to find percentages in a text. 
    We will be looking for two subsequent tokens: a number and percent sign. 

    - Use the like_num token attribute to check whether a token in the doc resembles a number. 
    - Get the token following the current token in the document. The index of the next token in the doc is token.i + 1. 
    - Check whether the next token's text attribute is a percent sign "%".
